# App to store

## Main process

- Create a Linglong project and use ll-builder to build a Linglong app locally.

- Submit a pull request to the [https://github.com/linuxdeepin/linglong-hub](https://github.com/linuxdeepin/linglong-hub) project.

- After the project maintainer approves the content, the build process is triggered. After the build is successful, the content will be submitted to the test repository of linglong, and the github action can obtain the build log and status.

- After the app test passed, it will be put on the [Linglong Web Store](http://10.0.33.45:28803).
